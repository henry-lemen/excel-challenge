Written Report
Draw Three Conclusions from the Data.

Overall, campaigns are more likely to be successful. Based on the data seen in the crowdfunding goal analysis, the percentage successful is higher than the percentage failed in every category except for 10000 to 14999 and greater than 50000. Also, the number of successful campaigns is higher than failed campaigns for every category other than games.
On average, the more backers a campaign has, the more likely it is to be successful. This can be told since the successful backers have a higher mean than the failed backers.
Theater is the most popular crowdfunding category since it has the highest total across successful, live, canceled, and failed categories. More specifically, plays are the most popular category.
State Limitations of the Dataset and Suggestions for Additional Tables of Graph

A limitation of the data set would be the differences in currency. An additional table/ graph to evaluate would be the amount pledge/ percent funded by country/ currency. Since the different currencies have different values, an additional detail to evaluate could be the z-score, since this levels the playing field in relation to the data.
Statistical Analysis:
Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.

The Median better summarizes the data as it is not skewed by outliers. In this case, the data is skewed right, which you can tell since the mean is greater than the median.
Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

The successful campaigns have more variability, which can be told since there is a higher standard deviation. This makes sense, because there are more successful campaigns than failed campaigns.
